# Photohub - php gallery project
This is a photohub project for the PHP/SQL course in Laurea UAS. The idea was to make simple gallery where users can save thier images , view and delete them but view images uploded by other users as well

# Installation steps

Install XAMPP

Copy the project files into the "htdocs" folder  under the XAMPP folder into a "photohub" or any other folder.

Open PHPMyAdmin on your browser, you can create "photohub" database and user & ea_gallery tables in it

Or you can import database by using photohub.sql which is easer and faster. Check are the table relations are functioning 

Enter in browser url: http://localhost/photohub/index.php but you may need to add ":80" before localhost in some cases


So, hopefully it runs smoothly and without any issues
